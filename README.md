# six_in_one
Basic idea of this repo is to get one app done in six languages: C++, C#, Python, Java, Ruby, JavaScript.

Current status: C# implemented, Java version in progress.

This is the same command interpreter application written in six languages that includes:
+ File move operation;
+ File copy operation;
+ File delete operation;
+ File rename operation;
+ Listing the contents of a directory;
+ A command processor to control all of this.
