# six_in_one
Basic idea of this repo is to get one app done in six languages: C++, C#, Python, Java, Ruby, JavaScript.

Current status: implementing the C# version.

So far there is one project which is a console file utility which has:
+ File move operation;
+ File copy operation;
+ File delete operation;
+ File rename operation;
- Dumping a directory tree to:
   A. Screen
   B. File
+ A command processor to control all of this.

TODO C#:
- Figure out a way to generalize directory traversal class;
- Write following directory traversal commands:
  - Directory list (print for directories + all contents).
