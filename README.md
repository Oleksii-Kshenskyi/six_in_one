# six_in_one
Basic idea of this repo is to get one app done in six languages: C++, C#, Python, Java, Ruby, JavaScript.

So far there is one project which is a console file utility which has:
- File move operation;
- File copy operation;
- File delete operation;
- File rename operation;
- Batch operations for all of them;
- Dumping a directory tree to:
   A. Screen
   B. File
- A command processor to control all of this.
